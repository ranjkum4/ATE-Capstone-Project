### Description

To develop a comprehensive QA and test environment for an airline booking website, including browser-based end-user testing using Selenium WebDriver, unit testing for backend elements using TestNG, API testing with Postman on AWS cloud, and automation of the testing process through the creation of a Jenkins job

 

### Problem Statement:

This project requires end-to-end development of a comprehensive QA and test environment for an airline booking website.

This QA and test environment should be inclusive of the following testing layers:

Browser-based end-user testing using Selenium WebDriver
Unit testing for backend elements of the website using TestNG
API testing with Postman on AWS cloud
Automating the whole testing process by creating a Jenkins job
 

The end-deliverables will be executable scripts and modules, which can be run on demand for testing the airline booking web app.
